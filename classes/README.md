# Object Oriented Programming
We used simple illustrations in this module to show how you can create a class

```python
class SomeClass(object):
    pass
```

This simple declares a class that does nothing. You can also create contructor methods in python that extend basic setup of objects 

```python
class SomeClass(object):
    pass

    # creating a basic constructor method
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

## Inheritance
Inheritance in python is also done in a very simple way and can be implemented as shown.

```python
class SomeClass(object):
    pass

    # creating a basic constructor method
    def __init__(self):
        pass

class SomeOtherClass(SomeClass):
    pass

```
